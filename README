Erlog is a Prolog interpreter implemented in Erlang and integrated
with the Erlang runtime system, that runs in an Erlang process. It is a subset of the ISO Prolog standard. 

You should use this if you want to include some prolog functionality in a larger erlang system (Including Elixir, LFE, Joxa etc). If you want a stand alone prolog you are probably better off using a package like SWI Prolog. 

There are currently 3 ways of interacting with Erlog, you can use the Erlog REPL for ad hoc testing, you can create an Erlog implementation in a closure or you can create an Erlog instance in a gen_server. Which version you should use depends on your application. 

Erlog can also share data with an erlang program by way of an ETS table. Erlog includes commands to unify a goal with the contents of an ets table. It should also be possible to work with mnesia tables, but this has not yet been done. 

You can include erlog in your application with rebar, by adding it to the deps section of your rebar config file.
